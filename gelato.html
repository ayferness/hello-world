<h2> The Difference Between Gelato and Ice Cream  </h2>
<p>In the Italian language, gelato is the generic word for ice cream, independent of the style, so every kind of ice cream is referred to as gelato in Italian.In the English, however, the word gelato has come to be used to refer to a specific style of ice cream derived from the Italian artisanal tradition.</p>

<p> Is gelato better for you than ice cream? Gelato typically offers fewer calories, less sugar and lower fat content per serving than ice cream. The typical 3.5 oz. serving of vanilla gelato contains 90 calories and 3 grams of fat, compared to 125 calories and 7 grams of fat in the average vanilla ice cream.</p>
